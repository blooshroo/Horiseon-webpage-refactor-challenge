# Horiseon-webpage-refactor-challenge
First week coding bootcamp challenge; refactoring code for Horiseon webpage.

Took the starter code for "Horiseon" & refactored it to the best of my current ability.
Fixed broken link in navbar; 
Altered some CSS selectors to encompass more HTML elements and reduce lines of code;
Re-ordered CSS so it reads from the top of the webpage to the bottom.
Probably more; I regret not taking notes as I went along! 

Learned a lot on this challenge and quite enjoyed it.
