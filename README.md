# Horiseon-webpage-refactor-challenge
First week coding bootcamp challenge; refactoring code for Horiseon webpage.

## Site Description
Horiseon provides a PR service for businesses by increasing online traffic through
the use of SEO and social media marketing. This approach increases brand awareness 
and brings more clients in without the high cost of traditional marketing methods.
As such, Horiseon must have an online presence themselves! This is their website.

## What I did
Took the starter code for "Horiseon" & refactored it to the best of my current ability.
Fixed broken link in navbar; 
Altered some CSS selectors to encompass more HTML elements and reduce lines of code;
Re-ordered CSS so it reads from the top of the webpage to the bottom.
Probably more; I regret not taking notes as I went along! 

Learned a lot on this challenge and quite enjoyed it.
